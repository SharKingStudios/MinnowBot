# June 4th: Preliminary Electrical Design

Created the planning document and found components I can use for the control electronics PCB.
I am planning on using a ESP32 type of controller as the main controller and a MP6536 for the various BLDC motors.
I am thinking on having a mecanum drivetrain with 4 BLDC motors, 2 more motors for the flywheel shooter, and 1 more for the intake.

I am planning on having a 3D printed chassis with a custom control PCB.
